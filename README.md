# aria2-static-build

![Build and Release](https://github.com/rzhy1/aria2-static-build/actions/workflows/build_and_release.yml/badge.svg)

aria2 static build using musl and support many platforms.

## Download

You can download from  [latest release](https://github.com/rzhy1/aria2-static-build/releases/latest) build (Build from aria2 latest release version).

> **NOTE**: If you were executed in Android environment (maybe x86_64, arm, or aarch64), please follow the official aria2 Android README: https://github.com/aria2/aria2/blob/master/README.android
>
> Here is a sample:
>
> ```sh
> cat /etc/security/cacerts/* | ./aria2c --ca-certificate=/proc/self/fd/0 --async-dns-server=1.1.1.1 https://github.com/
> ```
>
> Please note `getprop net.dns1` does not work since Android 8, so you have to set a valid DNS manually.

## https certificates NOTE (Linux Only)

SSL certificates location may vary from different distributions. E.g: Ubuntu uses `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`, but CentOS uses `/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt`.

It's impossible to detect certificates location in all distributions. See issue: [openssl/openssl#7481](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/7481). But luckily most distributions may contains a symbol link `/etc/ssl/cert.pem` which point to the actual file path.

So I set compile options `--openssldir=/etc/ssl/` for openssl/libressl. Which works for most distributions.

If your environment contains file `/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf` or `/etc/ssl/cert.pem`, you were luckly and you can use my build out-of-box.

But if your environment does not contain any of the files, you have to do one of the following settings to make https request could work.

- add `--ca-certificate=/path/to/your/certificate` to `aria2c` or set `ca-certificate=/path/to/your/certificate` in `~/.aria2/aria2.conf`. E.g: `./aria2c --ca-certificate=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt https://github.com/`
- Or add `SSL_CERT_FILE=/path/to/your/certificate` environment variable before you run `aria2c`. E.g: `export SSL_CERT_FILE=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt; ./aria2c https://github.com/` or `SSL_CERT_FILE=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt ./aria2c https://github.com/`

## Build locally yourself

Requirements:

- docker

```sh
docker run --rm -v "%cd%:/app" rzhy/ubuntu1:x86_64-w64-mingw32 /bin/bash -c "cd /app && ./build.sh"
```

All avaliable `CROSS_HOST` can be found in [Tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/rzhy/ubuntu/tags) page.

**NOTE**: Currently I only tested these tags:

- x86_64-w64-mingw32

If you want to build for other platform, you may have to modify `build.sh` to suitable for your platform.

Cached build dependencies (`downloads/`), `build_info.md` and `aria2c` will be found in current directory.

You can set more optional environment variables in `docker` command like:

```sh
docker run --rm -e USE_ZLIB_NG=1 -e USE_LIBRESSL=1 -e USE_CHINA_MIRROR=0 -v "%cd%:/app" rzhy/ubuntu:x86_64-w64-mingw32 /bin/bash -c "cd /app && ./build.sh"
```

Optional environment variables:

- `ARIA2_VER`: build specific version of aria2, e.g: `1.37.0`. Default: `master`.
- `USE_CHINA_MIRROR`: set to `1` will use China mirrors, if you were located in China, please set to `1`. Default: `0`.
- `USE_ZLIB_NG`: use [zlib-ng](https://github.com/zlib-ng/zlib-ng) instead of [zlib](https://zlib.net/). Default: `1`
- `USE_LIBRESSL`: use [LibreSSL](https://www.libressl.org/) instead of [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/). Default: `0`. **_NOTE_**, if `CROSS_HOST=x86_64-w64-mingw32` will not use openssl or libressl because aria2 and all dependencies will use WinTLS instead.
